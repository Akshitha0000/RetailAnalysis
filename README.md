Retail Analysis Readme Document

Welcome to the Retail Analysis project repository. This repository contains multiple files aimed at facilitating comprehensive analysis of retail operations. Below is an overview of the files included in this repository along with a description of the generated Power BI report:

Files Included:
Product Category: This file provides information about the various categories of products available in the retail store. It includes category IDs, names, and any relevant attributes associated with each category.

Sub Category: Delve deeper into product categorization with this file, which provides sub-categories within each main category. It contains sub-category IDs, names, and possibly other attributes defining each sub-category.

Customer Lookup: Contains information regarding customers, including unique identifiers, demographic details, purchase history, loyalty status, and any other relevant customer-related data.

Territory Lookup: Details about territories or geographical regions served by the retail operation. It may include territory IDs, names, sales performance within each territory, and other relevant geographical information.

Employee Lookup: Lists details about employees working within the retail establishment. It includes employee IDs, names, positions, contact information, and possibly performance metrics or other relevant data.

Sales by Store: A comprehensive overview of sales transactions across different stores or outlets. Includes details such as store IDs, sales dates, product IDs, quantities sold, prices, and any other pertinent sales-related information.

Product Lookup: Detailed information about each product available in the store. Includes product IDs, names, descriptions, pricing, suppliers, and possibly other attributes like inventory levels or sales history.

Calendar: A structured calendar with dates, days of the week, months, and any special events or holidays relevant to the retail business. Helps analyze sales patterns over time and plan promotions or campaigns accordingly.

Food Inventory: Focuses specifically on inventory management for food products within the retail store. Includes details such as product IDs, quantities in stock, expiration dates, replenishment schedules, and any other relevant inventory-related data.

Data Modeling:
The Power BI report generated from the data includes a robust data modeling approach:

Data Relationships: Established relationships between different data tables to create a coherent and interconnected dataset. This allows for seamless navigation and analysis across various aspects of retail operations.

Dimensional Modeling: Utilized dimensional modeling techniques to organize data into dimensions (such as products, customers, time) and fact tables (containing transactional data). This enhances the efficiency of querying and analysis.

Data Transformation: Applied data transformation techniques to clean, transform, and enrich the raw data for better usability and analysis within the Power BI environment.

DAX Calculations: Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom calculations, measures, and KPIs to analyze various aspects of retail performance such as sales growth, profitability, and customer behavior.

Advanced Analysis: Leveraged advanced analytical features in Power BI to perform sophisticated analyses such as cohort analysis, market basket analysis, and forecasting to gain deeper insights into retail operations.

Multiple Sheets for Excel Dashboard: The report includes multiple sheets tailored for Excel dashboards, providing easy exportability and compatibility for further analysis or presentation purposes.

Drill Down Capabilities: Implemented drill-down capabilities within the report to enable users to explore data at different levels of granularity, allowing for additional analysis and insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior.
